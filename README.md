# marque

_marque_, in french, means _mark_. It is a **self hosted** bookmark application.

The server-side is built with ExpressJS and uses a simple JSON file as database.
The client is build with Angular.

Originally, they were implemented as separate projects - not even working together.
The server was implemented in Javascript and the client was implemented first in
AngularJS and later in Angular2.

This project brings them together in a single project, implemented in Typescript.
And, of course, in new and improved form! A notable omission, today, is _Angular
Material_, just to experiment with custom themes. But, it might be added back, if
custom themes don't go as planned.

Beyond immediate utility, this project can be used as seed for building other
applications using same technologies.
